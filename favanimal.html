<p>For as long as I can remember, I have wanted to work with animals in one way or another.
     Currently, I am a senior pre-veterinary student at the University of Connecticut, 
     so clearly the medicine aspect won out. However, animal behavior was a close second. 
     I really enjoy learning the personalities of different animals, and the best
      ways to react to and train them. Dogs and the differences between their breeds especially 
      interest me, because every breed has some significant differences to learn about. 
      These differences make them best suited for different types of families, and 
      it's best to do your diligent research before deciding on an animal to add to your family.</p>

<p>Throughout my years of learning, and my ever growing list of experiences with different 
    animals, I have learned a lot about different breeds of dogs, and I have a lot of friends
     and family members ask me for my opinion when it comes to choosing a 4 legged, barking 
     friend to add to their family. Now, I'm no expert by any means, but I am definitely 
     doing my own research to hopefully someday be one. Here is a list of my 5 favorite 
     breeds of dogs and the families I think they would be best suited for. 

<p>Greyhounds have always had a soft spot in my heart. I have always been drawn to their unique
     physique, and I love hearing the stories of the rescue racing greyhounds who retire to 
     n the family life. My family used to foster rescue greyhounds, and we learned so much 
     about the breed. One common misconception about greyhounds is they need to live with an 
     active family who can help them run out their abundance of energy. That is actually a 
     myth, and greyhounds are considered the cats of the dog world. They have short bursts of 
     energy, but otherwise enjoy lazing around all day. I mean, think about it. When racing, 
     they run for short sprints, and then they sleep in their quarters for the rest of the day.
